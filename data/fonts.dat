Name: Intel One Mono
Description:
<p>Introducing Intel One Mono, an expressive monospaced font family that’s built with clarity, legibility, and the needs of developers in mind.</p>
<p>It’s easier to read, and available for free, with an open-source font license.</p>
<p>Identifying the typographically underserved low-vision developer audience, Frere-Jones Type designed the Intel One Mono typeface in partnership with the Intel Brand Team and VMLY&R, for maximum legibility to address developers' fatigue and eyestrain and reduce coding errors. A panel of low-vision and legally blind developers provided feedback at each stage of design.</p>
<p>Intel One Mono also covers a wide range of over 200 languages using the Latin script. The Intel One Mono fonts are provided in four weights — Light, Regular, Medium, and Bold — with matching italics, and we are happy to share both an official release of fonts ready to use as well as editable sources.</p>

<p>Meet the IBM Plex® typeface, our corporate typeface family. It’s global, it’s versatile and it’s distinctly IBM.</p>
<p>We designed the IBM Plex typeface carefully to meet our needs as a global tech company and express who we are as IBMers. It took two years and a lot of work to get here, but today, we have a signature typeface we’re proud of and excited to share with the world. Discover more about our development of the IBM Plex typeface.</p>
<p>The IBM Plex typeface is an open-source project available for download and various uses following the Open Font License (OFL). The IBM Plex family comes in Sans, Serif, Mono, and Sans Condensed, all with Roman and true italics. Plex has been designed to work well in user interface (UI) environments and other mediums. This project provides all source files and multiple formats to support most typographical situations. Currently, IBM Plex Sans supports extended Latin, Arabic, Chinese (Traditional), Cyrillic, Devanagari, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, and Thai.</p>
<p>Additionally, we have introduced IBM Plex® Math. This highly anticipated release includes over 5,000 new glyphs, covering a wide range of mathematical symbols such as alphanumeric, double-struck, Fraktur, operators, script, icons, arrows, Greek letters, phonetics, technical and geometric shapes — making it one of the most complete math fonts available today. IBM Plex Math provides a fresh and comprehensive alternative to STIX and Microsoft’s Cambria. Its compatibility with IBM Plex Serif Regular makes it an ideal choice for IBM researchers and mathematicians.</p>

Description:
<p>Andika is a sans-serif font family designed and optimized especially for use as a literacy font. It supports a near-complete range of Unicode characters for the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. These two scripts are used to write thousands of languages around the world.</p>
<p>In addition, Andika includes a comprehensive range of diacritics and character variants, making it an excellent literacy font. Also included is a large set of symbols useful for linguistic notation and description.</p>
<p>Many literacy specialists prefer creating materials with a sans serif font – one in which the letters have no “little feet” – for teaching both children and adults to read. For years, these reading specialists have had to make do with fonts that were not really suitable for beginning readers and writers. In some cases, they have had to hunt for and then tediously assemble letters from a variety of fonts in order to get all of the characters they need for their particular language. This results in potentially confusing publications.</p>
<p>The Andika literacy font addresses these and other issues with clear, simply designed letters. This facilitates letter recognition, a skill second only to distinguishing sounds in learning to read.</p>

Description:
<p>Fira Code is a free monospaced font containing ligatures for common programming multi-character combinations. This is just a font rendering feature: underlying code remains ASCII-compatible. This helps to read and understand code faster. For some frequent sequences like .. or //, ligatures allow us to correct spacing.</p>
